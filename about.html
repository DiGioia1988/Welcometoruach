  <h1>About the Trail Team</h1>
  <p>I'm a deaf hiker who loves exploring nature’s beauty in national parks. My loyal sidekick is an Aussie named Pumpa 🐾.</p>

  <p>We spend weekends on the trail and share stories, tips, and cool products like <em>PawFuel™</em> — dog treats with trail-boosting power!</p>
